# iOS_Swift_Course

These are some of the many projects I have completed by following along to Dr. Angela Yu's iOS & Swift Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp on Udemy.

The course includes various projects from understanding auto-layout in Xcode to creating weather applications, chat apps using Firebase (as of writing this isn't on GitHub until I double check for any API keys in the code), and some machine learning apps (Plantr and SeeFood). 

The course can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/)
